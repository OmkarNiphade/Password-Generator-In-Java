>>Introduction for a Password Generator Project in Java :-
A Password Generator is a tool or program designed to create secure and random passwords to enhance the security of user accounts, applications, or systems. This project involves implementing a password generator using Java, leveraging its robust libraries and features.

>>Purpose of the Project :-
With the growing prevalence of cyber threats, weak passwords remain a significant vulnerability. A password generator ensures the creation of strong and unpredictable passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. This project aims to demonstrate how to build such a tool while adhering to good programming practices.

>>Key Features :-
1) Customizable Password Length: Users can specify the desired length of the password.
2) Character Type Selection: Users can choose the inclusion of:
   --Uppercase letters
   --Lowercase letters
   --Numbers
   --Special characters
3) Randomness and Security: The program uses secure random algorithms to generate unpredictable passwords.
4) User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive and straightforward way to configure and generate passwords.

>>Learning Outcomes :-
--Understanding the use of random number generation in Java (java.util.Random or java.security.SecureRandom).
--Working with StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation.
--Enhancing knowledge of conditional statements and loops.
--Developing a modular and maintainable code structure.
--Improving problem-solving skills and Java programming proficiency.

>>Project Applications :-
--Securing online accounts with strong passwords.
--Demonstrating Java programming skills in a real-world application.
--Gaining insights into basic cryptographic concepts and secure coding practices.
